### Components

 - [Sendero Server](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoServer)
 
	Main component of Sendero software architecture. Responsible of blending   the visual content generated by *Sendero Clients* and distributing the result to *Sendero Server* and *Sendero Streaming Server*.
	 
 - [Sendero Middleware](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoMiddleware)

	Piece of *middleware* in charge of receiving, processing and retransmitting Sendero Art-Net packets sent by *Sendero Server*. It also manages the wireless devices running *Sendero Lighting Firmware*.

 - [Sendero Lighting Firmware](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoLightingFirmware)
	
	To lighten the LED stripes, a NodeMCU DevKit running *Sendero Lighting Firmware* is needed. The main goal of this module is to work as a wireless controller for the LED driver.
	
 - [Sendero Streaming Server](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoStreamingServer)
	
	Web server made for the distribution of the generated color data to all web clients running *Sendero Web Apps*.

 - [Sendero Interaction Server](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoInteractionServer)
	
	Receives commands in representation of the interactions made by users of *Sendero Web Apps*. These interactions are transmited to *Sendero Interaction Clients* which process them to generate color information for the artwork.

 - [Sendero Web Apps](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoWebApps)
	
	Two real-time web applications. One designed to visualize and interact with Sendero artworks and the second to visualize it in VR. To achieve this, they use *Sendero Streaming Server* (to receive the data to paint pixels) and *Sendero Interaction Server* /to interact with the artwork in real-time).

 - [Sendero (Generic) Client](https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/SenderoGenericClient_Linux)
	
	Sendero component in charge of generating the lighting patterns and delivering it to Sendero Server.
